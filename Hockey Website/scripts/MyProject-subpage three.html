    <br> </br>
    <h2> Skating</h2>
    <div "skating-image-container">
        <img class="skills-images" src="..\images/forward-skate.jpg" alt="player skating forward">
        <img class="skills-images" src="..\images/backward-skate.jpg" alt="player skating backward">
        <img class="skills-images" src="..\images/crossover.jpeg" alt="player crossing over">
    </div>

    <p id="forward" class="text-skills"> Forward skating is probably the most important area in skating (as it's used
        all the time). You skate forwards by pushing behind you at about 8 and 4 o'clock. <br> </br> </p>

    <p id="backward" class="text-skills"> Backward skating is also pretty important. Although, backwards skating is
        mostly used by defenceman to try to defend the opposing team's attack or rush. You skate backwards by making the
        letter "c" into the ice.</p>

    <p id="crossover" class="text-skills"> Crossovers happen when you put one leg in front of the other to accelerate
        yourself. They are used when you want to transition and accelerate the other way (i.e: from Defensize zone to
        Offensive zone or vice versa). </p>

    <h2 id="stickhandle-header"> Stick-Handling </h2>

    <div class = "stickhandling-image-container">
        <img class = "skills-images"  src = "..\images/stick-handling.jpg" alt = "player controlling puck around cones">
        <img class = "skills-images" id = "three-holes" src = "..\images/stickhandling-threeholes.jpg" alt = "player controlling puck around obstacle with 3 openings">
        <img class = "skills-images" src = "..\images/toedrag.jpg" alt = "player toedragging the puck">
    </div>

    <p class = "text-skills" id = "first-stickhandle"> Stickhandling is used to control and protect the puck when skating down the ice. The top hand, which controls the majority of the stickhandling, goes at the very top of the stick. The bottom hand is used to support the top hand, and goes just above the middle part of the stick.</p>

    <p class = "text-skills" id = "second-stickhandle"> "Deking" or "dangling" reffers to the process of maneuvering your way around the opponents by using stick handling skills. The opponent always has 2 holes that you could put the puck through: <span class = "shot-list"> <br>  1. In between their skates <br> 2. Through their stick. <span> </p>

    <p class = "text-skills" id = "toedrag-text"> The most common deke/dangle is the toedrag. This is most oftenly used to get around opponent in order to release a quick shot. The toe drag involves: <span class = "shot-list"><br> 1. Bringing the puck out wide to your side, with the puck being at the very end of your stick blade <br> 2. Dragging the puck with the toe of your stick, towards the midline of your body. </span></p> 

    <p id = "arrow-one"> &#8592; Toe</p>
    <p id = "arrow-two"> &#8592; Stick blade (entire bottom part) </p>
    <p id = "arrow-three"> &#8592;</p>
  

    <h2 id="shooting-header"> Shooting </h2>

    <div class = "shooting-image-container">
        <img  class = "skills-images"  src = "..\images/wristshot.jpg" alt = "player taking a wristshot">
        <img  class = "skills-images" src = "..\images/slapshot.jpg" alt = "player taking a slapshot">
        <img  class = "skills-images" id = "snapshot" src = "..\images/snapshot.jpg" alt = "player taking a snapshot">
    </div>

    <p class = "text-skills" id = "wristshot-text"> The wristshot is the most common and easiest shot in all of hockey, especially used by forwards. It involves: <span class = "shot-list"> <br> 1. Bringing the puck a little behind you, with the puck being at the middle of the blade Putting weight on your back leg <br> 2. Dragging the puck forward, while transferring weight to your front leg <br> 3. Following through by pointing your stick to your target </span> </p>

    <p class = "text-skills" id = "slapshot-text"> The slapshot is the most powerful shot in hockey and is most commonly used by defenceman near the blueline. It involves: <span class = "shot-list"> <br> 1. Raising your stick behind you </br> 2. Putting weight on your back leg <br>  3. Bringing your stick forward and touching a little bit of the ice, while bringing weight to your front leg <br> 4. Hitting the puck with the middle of your blade <br>5. Following through by pointing your stick to your target  </span> </p>

    <p class = "text-skills" id = "snapshot-text"> The snapshot is the quickest shot in hockey. It involves: <span class = "shot-list"> <br>  1. Setting the puck a little in front of you <br> 2. Putting weight on one leg and transitioning the weight onto the other leg, while simultaneously releasing the puck <br> 3. Following through by pointing your stick to your target. </span> </p> 

    <p id = "shooting-note"> Note: Shooting power for all shots is generated by the right amount of flex of the stick (the bend of the stick). <br> <br> <u>Remember: </u> <span id = "note-for-shot"><br> <br>Flex + full-body weight transfer = power <br> <br> Pointing your stick to the target = accuracy </span></p>

    <h2 id="defensive-header"> Defensive Techniques </h2>

    <div class = "defensive-image-container">
        <img class = "skills-images" src = "..\images/bodychecking.jpg" alt = "player bodychecking other player into boards">
        <img class = "skills-images" src = "..\images/pokecheck.jpg" alt = "player pokechecking puck away from other player">
        <img class = "skills-images" id = "sticklift-image" src = "..\images/sticklift.jpg" alt = "player sticklifting puck away from other player">

    </div>

    <p class = "text-skills" id = "bodycheck-text"> The bodycheck is the most violent and physical defensive technique. It is most commonly done along the boards, but can also be done in open ice (away from the boards). The bodycheck is accomplished by driving your shoulder into the shoulder of the opposing player. It is important that this collision is shoulder to shoulder to avoid major injuries.</p>
    <p class = "text-skills" id = "pokecheck-text"> The pokecheck is the most common defensive technique. It is done by extending your stick to "poke" the puck away from the other player.  </p>
    <p class = "text-skills" id = "sticklift-text"> The sticklift is probably the most efficient technique. It is done by using your stick to quickly lift the bottom-middle part of the opposing player's stick, and taking the puck away from them. </p>
