    <div class="hockey-paragraphs">
        <p class="hockey-paragraph-description"> The game of hockey is played with a cylyndrical puck and a long stick
            with a curvy end. Players wear skates to move around the ice and protective equipment such as helmets and
            tons of padding all over the body to protect themselves (hockey can be dangerous!). There are three 20 minute periods in hockey. The goal of the game is to use your stick to get the puck in the opposing net (scoring a goal). The best way to score is to pass the puck to cover more ice. In the game of hockey, there is 1
            goalie, 2 defenceman and 3 forwards on at a time.  </p>

        <p class="hockey-paragraph-description" id="right-paragraph"> In a typical hockey game, there are always
            substitutions for the forwards and the defenceman. In total, a team will carry 12 forwards and 6 defenceman.
            Each set of 3 forwards is referred to as a "forward line". Similarly, each set of 2 defenceman is called a
            "defensive pair". The 1st forward line is the line that starts the game and usually contains the best
            forwards or the forwards that play the best together. The 1st defensive pair similarly consists of the 2
            best defenceman. In regards to goalies, a team will carry 2 goalies, with 1 of those goalies playing the
            entire game. The goalie playing the game is known as the "starter", while the goalie sitting on the bench is
            known as the "backup". </p>

        <h3 id="heading-zones"> There are 3 zones in the hockey rink:</h3>
        <ol id="list-zones">
            <li id="The Defensize zone"> <u>The Defensive (Defending) zone </u> <br> This is the zone that your team is
                defending
                in. In
                other words, this is the area of the ice where you try to stop the other team from scoring a goal in
                your net. In this zone, players will block shots from the opposing team and will do anything in their
                power to get the puck out of this zone. </br> </li>
            <li> <u> The Neutral zone </u> <br> This is the zone that your team is trying to get into the offensive zone
                (or the defensive zone of the other team). This area of ice should be well contested as it serves as a
                passageway to get into the dangerous areas closer to your oppononent's net. </br> </li>
            <li> <u> The Offensive (Attacking) zone </u> <br> This is the zone that you want to be in if you want to
                score goals and
                win games. In this area of the ice, players pass the puck, use fancy stick tricks to get past defenders
                and ultimately shoot the puck into the net past the goalie. </br> </li>
