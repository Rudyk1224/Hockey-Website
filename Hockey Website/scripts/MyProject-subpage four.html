    <div id = "intro-paragraph"> 
    <p> Penalties are what constitute the rules of hockey. Penalties occur when a player breaks the rules of hockey, and is punished by sitting in the penalty bench. Depending on the severity of the penalty and the intent, players can sit in the penalty box for either 2 minutes, 4 minutes, 5 minutes, or be suspended for the entire rest of the game. When a player from a team commits a penalty, the other team gains a 1 player advantage. The team who took a penalty now has 1 less player on the ice, resulting in a 1 player advantage for the other team (i.e: team A takes a penalty, so now it is a 5 players vs 4 players advantage for the other team). It is important that if the same team takes another penalty, then it is a 2 man advntage for the other team (i.e: 5 players v 3 players). </p>

    <p> The team who takes a penalty (or the team with the less amount of players) is now on the "penalty kill". The penalty kill is a hockey term describing the team with less players that must "kill off" the minutes of the penalty (i.e: 2 minutes) without surrendering a goal.</p>
    <p> The team who draws a penalty (the team with more amount of players) is now on the "powerplay" The powerplay describes the team with the advantage that has a better chance of scoring a goal, due to having more players. If a goal is scored on the powerplay, the remaining minutes on the penalty will be erased and the player serving the penalty will be released (to go back to regular 5 on 5 play).</p>
