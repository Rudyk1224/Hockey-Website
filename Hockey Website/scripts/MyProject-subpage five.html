    <span class = "blurb-text"> Hello my name is Paul Maurice and I am a professional hockey coach. I'm here to explain the strategy that I like to employ on the powerplay (or PP for short). First things first, I like to have one defenceman at the point to create shots, both wingers rotating between the half wall (near the boards) and behind the net to create passes and quick shots, and the center rotating between the front of the net (to redirect shots and to screen/stand in front of the goalie to block his vision), and the slot area (between the faceoff circles near the goalie). My favourite play on the powerplay has got to be a quick threeway pass from the defenceman to the winger to the center. </span>

    <span class = "blurb-text"> Hey, my name's Mike Babcock, or Babs for short. I have had a long pro coaching career and can't wait to dive deep into the penalty kill. I love my penalty kill strategy especially when my players follow it. I like to have 2 forwards and 2 defenceman on my penalty (or PK for short). One defenceman is always making sure the front of the net stays clear by pushing the centerman from the other team away from the net. The other defenceman will be taking care of the area behind the net and making sure the opposing forwards stay in non-dangerous areas on the ice (such as the corners). One of my forwards will be in charge of covering the top area of the ice on one side, while the other winger will cover the top area of the other side. Both of my wingers will block shots when necessary (especially from the opposing defenceman). </span>

    <span class = "blurb-text"> Hey, this is me speaking, John Tortorella, a no-bullshit type of guy. Today I am going to be discussin the extra attacker strategy that I like to use in the last of couples of minutes of the game. When my boys are down by a goal or two and there's only a couple minutes left on the clock, I like to pull my goalie (get him off the ice and into our bench) in order to release another attacker (another player). This will give us that 6 players vs 5 players advantage which will give us a better chance of scoring to tie up the game. Of course, this also means that the opponent has an empty net to shoot at for an easy goal, but I believe in my guys to pull it off.</span>
